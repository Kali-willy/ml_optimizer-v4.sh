Here's how to run the ML optimizer script in Termux:

1. First, install Termux from the Google Play Store or F-Droid if you haven't already.

2. Open Termux and update the packages:
```
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

3. Install the required packages:
```
pkg install bash
```

4. Create the script file using a text editor:
```
nano ml_optimizer-v4.sh
```

5. Copy and paste the entire script into the text editor.

6. Save the file by pressing Ctrl+O, then Enter, and exit with Ctrl+X.

7. Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x ml_optimizer-v4.sh
```

8. Run the script:
```
./ml_optimizer-v4.sh
```

If you need root access for the advanced optimizations (which is recommended), you'll need to:

1. Install a root manager app like Magisk (if your device is rooted)
2. Install the Termux:API add-on from the same source as Termux
3. Install the necessary package in Termux:
```
pkg install tsu
```

4. Then run the script with root privileges:
```
tsu -c ./ml_optimizer-v4.sh
```

If you encounter any "Permission denied" errors when running without root, that's normal - the script is designed to skip those operations and only apply the non-root optimizations.

For best results, make sure Mobile Legends is closed before running the optimizer, then open it after the optimization completes.
